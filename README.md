# FigBO

This repository is the official implementation of FigBO: A Generalized Acquisition Function Framework with Look-Ahead Capability for Bayesian Optimization.

FigBO is a Bayesian optimization method based on a gamma-designed acquisition strategy, enabling a flexible and principled trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
